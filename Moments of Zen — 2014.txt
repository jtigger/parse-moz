### “We can’t learn anything new while focused on what we think we know.”
#### [Cheri Huber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheri_Huber)
### Explore: Pick something you know about yourself.
### Ask “how do I know that?”
### Spot the assumptions in that answer and drill in: “how do I know _that_?”
